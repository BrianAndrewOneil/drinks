## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

I built this app with an API integration that allows users to enter an ingredient (e.g., gin, whiskey) or the name of a cocktail in order to review a full ingredients list and directions to make that cocktail.

## Optimizations
Future enhancements for this app include a better mobile interface and the ability for users to review and select from a variety of recipe options.

## Lessons Learned
Constructing html lists from JSON returned via the API call.
