## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, bootstrap, & JavaScript

I built this app with an API integration that allows users to enter an ingredient (e.g., gin, whiskey) or the name of a cocktail in order to peruse a carousel of drink possibilities. After selecting one, the user is presented with an ingredients list and directions for preparing the drink.

## Optimizations
After posting the initial app, I upgraded a few features including: a better mobile interface, a search tool featuring autocomplete for all possible ingredients, and an image carousel to display the options available. Future enhancements will include using local storage to save the user's favorite recipes.

## Lessons Learned
Building an autocomplete search and an image carousel based on an API call.
